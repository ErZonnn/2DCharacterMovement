# 2D Character Movement

The 2D Character Movement Kit is a set that allows for character movement in two dimensions. It includes features such as running, jumping, dashing, wall sliding, wall jumping and launcher. Jumping on the walls and using the launcher gives the character extra speed.

The package also includes a script for controlling the camera and a simple menu, making it easy to implement these elements into your game.
